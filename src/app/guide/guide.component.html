                Display: Analogue (Analog) vs Digital Watches</p>
            <p style="text-align:left;font:bolder;font-size:x-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
            color: grey;">
                To begin your hunt for the perfect watch, you need to first decide on the display.
                 The top two display choices include analog and digital watches.<br><br>

Analogue Watches:<br>
 A common display for watches, Analogue watches display time via hands on the dial and include 
the hour hand, the minute hand, and the second hand. These watches are more traditional and elegant compared to 
a digital watch. These timepieces offer varied designs and are highly durable, making them a great choice for all
 occasions.<br>
Digital Watches:<br>
 These watches use an LCD screen to display time electronically. It is only available with quartz movement and 
displays time in minutes & hours while some digital watches also show seconds. Digital watches might not be as
 sophisticated or elegant as analog watches, but they are much more cost-effective. Some digital watches also 
 offer additional features such as calendar, timer, etc. However, they are prone to wear & tear and not ideal 
 for long-term use.
Hybrid watches (a combination of the first two) and touchscreen watches (includes a touchscreen display) are a 
few of the other wristwatches for men.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;font:bolder;font-size:xx-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times,
             serif;">Watch Movement: Quartz vs Mechanical</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:left;font:bolder;font-size:x-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
            color: grey;">Next, you need to consider the watch movement, which is the mechanism
             that drives (or give life) to the watch. Generally, they are divided into two categories – quartz
              and mechanical.<br><br>

Quartz:<br> This is the common type of mechanism used in watches and is known for its accuracy and durability.
 Compared to mechanical watches, quartz watches are more affordable & practical and can be distinguished from 
 the ‘jump’ the second hand makes, when moving from one second to another.<br>
Mechanical:<br> These watches have a rotor attached to the movement; run by mechanical parts. They can be either
 hand-wound (self–winding) or automatic (the rotor spins as your wrist moves). The motion of the second hand 
 is smooth & sweeping compared to quartz watches. However, mechanical watches are more expensive and not as 
 accurate as quartz watches.



      <p style="text-align:center;font:bolder;font-size:xx-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times,
             serif;">Energy Source: Quartz or Solar or Smartwatch</p>
         <p style="text-align:left;font:bolder;font-size:x-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
         color: grey;">When considering the different watch styles, you also need to check the energy 
         source that powers the watch. Quartz watches are battery-operated while solar watches are powered 
         by a solar cell that absorbs solar energy via photovoltaic solar cells to convert light into electrical
          energy. Smartwatches, in contrast, are powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. 


          <p style="text-align:center;font:bolder;font-size:xx-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times,
          serif;"> Design and Strap Material</p>


<p style="text-align:left;font:bolder;font-size:x-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
            color: grey;">If you are buying a watch for daily wear, stick to light, comfortable,
             and practical designs. Conventional and vintage designs are most suited for formal occasions
              as they have timeless appeal. Whereas, if you have an active lifestyle, buy functional watches 
              with high durability.<br>

Leather watch-band and stainless steel mesh straps are the most popular watch strap material used. 
High-quality strap material will ensure long-lasting use. When choosing a strap material, consider 
flexibility, high-strength, durability, comfort, sweat and water resistance. Apart from the above, 
other strap materials include mesh textured silicone band, ceramic watch-band, titanium watch-band, 
among others.

<p style="text-align:center;font:bolder;font-size:xx-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times,
             serif;">Comfort, Size and Budget</p>


<p style="text-align:left;font:bolder;font-size:x-large;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
            color: grey;">
            
            Your comfort level should be the top consideration when buying a watch. No matter how impressive
             and feature-rich the watch is, if doesn’t feel comfortable, it is not right for you.<br>

            When it comes to the size; depending on your wrist size, you can either choose a watch with a slim
             dial or an oversized watch like this limited-edition classic Bering watch for men.<br>
            
            Your budget can also influence your purchase decision. However, it is important to never
             compromise on quality and comfort based on the price tag. You can find the best wristwatches 
             for men online that are classy as well as affordable. So, choose a watch that complements
              your style and personality.</p>
